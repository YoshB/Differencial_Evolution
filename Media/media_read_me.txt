I demostrated the behaviour of the Differencial Evolution algorithm with these 3 highly complex functions:

-DropWave function: 
  Global minimun = -1, at x1 = x2 = 0
  
-Griewank function:
  Global minimun = 0, at x1 = x2,... xn = 0
  
-Rastrigin function
  Global minimun = 0, at x1 = x2, ... xn = 0
  
  
In the gifs, the blue colors represent lower values of the function, so the center is the lowest value, what we call
the global minimun, and you can see how the algorithm converge at this point very quickly.
In the images we can see how the functions are draw in a 3 dimensional space and the gloabl minimum it's marked with a red 'X'.
