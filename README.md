# Differencial_Evolution
Evolutionary algorithm to optimize functions

The differencial evolution (DE) algorithm is an metaheuristic algorithm, in the area of evolutionary algorithms. 
This algorithm is used to find the better combination of parameters in a function so we can apply this in many cases 
as find the incognites in an equation system, do linear or non linear regressions, optimize functions of cost to 
reduce the loss, and many others.
